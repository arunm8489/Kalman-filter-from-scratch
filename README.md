# Tracking a ball using Kalman-Filter

In statistics and control theory, Kalman filtering, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone

### Usage
*pip install -r requirements.txt*<br>
*python detect.py* <br>

By default this will run on ball.mp4 vedio. You can make neceesery changes in detect.py <br>
